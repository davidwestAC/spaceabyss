CURRENT GAMEPLAY TEST:
    Could have a ai_nofitications table that tracks the previous total energy for the AI. Something like every 10 minutes, and if the change is 
        negative, and total energy % is < 50%, send an email

    Still seems like dying from poison doesn't work completely correct. Just watch this

     

DOING NOW:

    Whenever I see a getPlanetCoordIndex, getShipCoordIndex, getCoordIndex, see if it's on a monster,object, or player, and switch it to TYPE.getCoordIndex()



    Destroyer movement is weird when someone else is moving it.

    need to add in damage type for floors

    damage on mining failure based on skill difference

    Galaxy events aren't spawning? (or the frzon planet has one)


    Players building AIs on things like Asteroid Cities that will disapper
        (Possibly just disallow that? - or a VERY clear warning?)

        Okapi built AI on Asteroid City - plus an AI core and 2 ai batteries

    For server health, add in # of things players have galaxy wide (algae, moss, ai dust, batteries, etc)
